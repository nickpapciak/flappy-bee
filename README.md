# FLAPPY BEE

Flappy Bee is the latest and hottest indie ~~mobile~~ Game Boy game of the 2010's.

When you launch the game, press *A* (**x** on the computer keyboard) to flap your wings! Green pipes will start barreling your way, so do your best to avoid them by pressing *A* to flap. When you inevitably smash face-first into a pipe, keep on trying and aim for a higher score. 

Happy flapping :)

## Notes: 
- This was a small Flappy Bird clone for a project in my low-level programming class. It was built in C and is built to be run on (or emulated on) Game Boy Advance hardware. I decided to publish it onto GitHub after winning first place in a class competition for the best game!
